# Preprocessing of the BibTeX-Data

For the preprocessing, we store individual BibTeX strings (for authors and editors) in a file `preprocessing.json` with manual corrections. Here, we collect those strings which we identify as problematic by conducting basic sanity checks (searching for names with brackets, for names with strange strings, such as `et al.` etc.).
