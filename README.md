# Initial Tests on Data Model and Data for the CLD Project

This repository provides some initial overview on tests and ideas regarding the data model and the data itself that we intent to model and assemble within the CLD project. Most notably, the repository provides an initial estimate regarding the core languages in Glottolog that should be assembled as part of the CLD project, along with an initial investigation of the sources per language that Glottolog assembles. 

For details, check the overview on:
* [Languages by Macro-Area](glottolog/languages.md#languages-by-macro-area)
* [Sources Per Variety](glottolog/statistics.md#sources-per-variety)
* [Basic Statistics](glottolog/statistics.md#sources-per-variety)
